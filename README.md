If you are not looking to modify the game, you can get the latest game build from the [releases tab](https://github.com/29cmb/Love2DRhythmGame/releases)

If you do wish to make modifications, you must first install [LOVE2D](https://www.love2d.org/)
Once you have that set up, use the [vs code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pixelbyte-studios.pixelbyte-love2d) to launch the love2d instance
